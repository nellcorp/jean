# Architecture Guide

High-level architectural overview and mental models for the Jean desktop application (Tauri + React).

## Philosophy

1. **Clarity over Cleverness** - Predictable patterns over magic
2. **AI-Friendly Architecture** - Clear patterns that AI agents can follow
3. **Performance by Design** - Patterns that prevent common performance pitfalls
4. **Security First** - Built-in security patterns for file system operations
5. **Extensible Foundation** - Easy to add new features without refactoring

## Mental Models

### GitHub issue and PR context scope

`load_issue_context` and `load_pr_context` attach references to a session through Inject Context or the chat `#` picker. The chat `@` picker adds files, not issues or PRs. A worktree can also have issue or PR references from its creation. For each type independently, explicit session references replace worktree references in the loaded-context lists and AI prompts. If a session has no references of that type, the worktree references are the fallback. Older sessions can contain copied worktree references; when they also contain a distinct session reference, only the distinct reference is effective. Do not copy worktree references into new sessions or merge the two scopes in a new prompt path. The shared context files remain reference-counted.

In the chat `#` picker, the plus action attaches an issue or PR to the active session and removes the typed `#` query from the chat draft. The sparkle action replaces that query with the configured investigation magic prompt and sends it right away: `ChatInput` calls `onSubmit` with a `beforeSend` callback that loads the context, and `handleSubmit` awaits it before it sends. The send is bound to the session that was active at submit time, so the user can switch sessions or worktrees while the context loads. If the load fails, the draft is restored and nothing is sent. On native desktop, Enter selects the row and Shift+Enter starts the investigation; mobile and Web Access show the tap actions without keyboard hints.

The picker shows issues and PRs in separate batches of eight. Each group has its own Load more button while more results are available. A new search or picker open resets both groups to eight results. The existing GitHub search finds results beyond the loaded list.

The picker header has a Refresh button beside Include closed/merged. It invalidates only the active project's issue, PR, security, advisory, and Linear context queries, so the visible menu fetches fresh results without refreshing unrelated projects.

**Investigate in the Current Worktree** creates a new session. Pass the selected issue context to `start_background_investigation`; the backend must save its session reference before it queues the prompt. This keeps the issue available to later commands in that session, including Comment & Close Issue.

### The "Onion" State Architecture

State management follows a clear three-layer hierarchy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           useState                  │  ← Component UI State
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │          Zustand                ││  ← Global UI State
│  │  ┌─────────────────────────────┐││
│  │  │      TanStack Query         │││  ← Persistent Data
│  │  └─────────────────────────────┘││
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Decision Tree:**

```
Is this data needed across multiple components?
├─ No → useState
└─ Yes → Does this data persist between app sessions?
    ├─ No → Zustand
    └─ Yes → TanStack Query
```

See [state-management.md](./state-management.md) for detailed patterns.

### Event-Driven Bridge Architecture

The Rust backend is the only consumer of persisted queued chat prompts. It
starts the next prompt after a run ends and resumes a queued session when that
session is opened after a restart. Frontend clients display `queue:updated` and
`chat:sending` events but must not dequeue or send queued prompts themselves.

Rust and React communicate through three patterns:

```
1. User Actions:
   Menu Click / Keyboard Shortcut / Command Palette → Command Execution → State Update

2. Frontend → Backend:
   React → invoke("command_name", args) → Rust handler → Response

3. Backend → Frontend:
   Rust background task → app.emit("event-name", data) → React listen() handler → State Update
   (Used by git status polling, PR status updates, worktree events)
```

### Backend-Owned Long-Running Jobs

Long-running operations that must survive web/mobile WebSocket disconnects
should be owned by Rust, not by a pending frontend `invoke()` response. The
frontend should start the job and receive an immediate job id; Rust
should run the process, persist the final state, and emit best-effort progress
events. After a disconnect-triggered reload, the frontend recovers from
persisted session/project data or job query commands instead of relying on the
original WebSocket response.

Current example: review magic uses `start_review_job`, which creates a Code
Review session with a running indicator and starts the AI/CodeRabbit review in a
Rust background task. AI review supports up to five distinct backend/model pairs
per worktree; each pair has its own model-compatible reasoning level. A batch of
AI reviews shares one Code Review session, and `review_results` stores the
backend/model results together so the review panel can switch between them;
entries are created with a running status so the dropdown can show loading
state before each result arrives.

### Client and Server Preference Ownership

Preferences use a strict ownership boundary. Display, input, notification, and
native-application choices are client-local and persist in the versioned
`jean-client-preferences-v1` browser storage record. Workflow and operational
configuration—including favorites, AI defaults, Magic Prompts, Git behavior,
providers, MCP, CLI sources, integrations, and Web Access—is instance-wide on
the selected Jean service.

`usePreferences()` temporarily overlays client values onto the legacy server
response so existing consumers remain compatible. `usePatchPreferences()`
partitions updates: client keys never cross the backend transport, while server
keys continue to use backend persistence. New code can use
`useClientPreferences()` directly.

Project and worktree display state uses the same ownership rule through the
versioned `jean-client-view-state-v1` browser storage record. This includes
canvas sorting and active filters, tree expansion, dashboard favorites, sidebar
layout, and browser/terminal layout. Pinned recent sessions and pinned canvas
label filters are shared through server UI state instead. Resource-keyed values
must use scoped server resource IDs. `useClientViewStatePersistence()` migrates the legacy
server UI-state values on first load and then makes the client record
authoritative. Keep session data, running terminal metadata, drafts, and other
operational state in the backend persistence paths.

Each server owns the pins of its own recent sessions. Pins change only through
`set_recent_session_pinned` (one ID per call); `save_ui_state` keeps the pins
that are on disk, so a full save from one client cannot drop another client's
pin. Native Jean reads each remote server's pins with
`get_pinned_recent_session_ids` and merges them with its local pins
(`src/services/recent-session-pins.ts`). An "Unknown command" answer marks an
older server; native Jean then keeps that server's pins in its local UI state
and moves them to the server after the server is updated.

Servers expose `get_server_preferences`, `update_server_preferences`, and
`get_server_capabilities`. Server preference responses omit client fields and
redact secrets to configured flags. Updates use an opaque revision string to
detect concurrent edits. Capabilities provide the server-owned Magic Prompt
catalog/defaults; the React UI retains bundled fallbacks for older servers.
Duplicate pairs are rejected while running. Job progress emits
`review-job:updated`.

### Command-Centric Design

All user actions flow through a centralized command system:

- **Commands** are pure objects with `execute()` functions
- **Context** provides all state and actions commands need
- **Registration** merges commands from different domains at runtime

This decouples UI triggers from implementations and enables consistent behavior.

## System Architecture

### Core Systems

Each major system has focused documentation:

- **[Command System](./command-system.md)** - Unified action dispatch
- **[Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard-shortcuts.md)** - Native event handling
- **[Native Menus](./menus.md)** - Cross-platform menu integration
- **[Data Persistence](./data-persistence.md)** - Disk storage patterns
- **[State Management](./state-management.md)** - Zustand + TanStack Query patterns
- **[Notifications](./notifications.md)** - Toast and native notifications
- **[Logging](./logging.md)** - Rust and TypeScript logging
- **[Performance](./performance-patterns.md)** - Render optimization patterns
- **[Testing](./testing.md)** - Quality gates and test patterns
- **[Releases](./releases.md)** - Automated release process
- **[Auto-Updates](./auto-updates.md)** - Update system integration
- **[Bundle Optimization](./bundle-optimization.md)** - Build size optimization

Additional systems (no dedicated docs yet):

- **Jean-managed CLI terminal access** - When a backend uses a Jean-managed
  CLI and no independent executable is available on `PATH`, Jean exposes the
  managed binary to normal terminals. Unix and WSL use stable links in
  `~/.local/bin`; Windows uses a launcher in the per-user `WindowsApps`
  directory, which is on the standard user `PATH`. Jean repairs these launchers
  on startup and after managed installs or upgrades. A real system `PATH`
  installation always takes precedence.

- **Required agent integrations** - Jean MCP and Agent Browser are mandatory
  runtime services. Startup always enables the Jean MCP socket, repairs the
  supported CLI config entries, and installs Agent Browser plus Chrome for
  Testing when they are missing. These repairs run in the background so the UI
  and HTTP server do not wait for a first-run browser download. Legacy
  `jean_mcp_enabled: false` values are migrated to `true`, and Agent Browser is
  always included in effective MCP server selection. The Settings controls can
  report status and retry a failed repair, but cannot disable either service.
  Agent Browser installation follows the official `npm install agent-browser`
  and `agent-browser install` flow:
  https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser#installation
  Jean uses `agent-browser@latest` for its managed npm prefix. Do not remove
  the explicit tag: npm otherwise keeps the existing caret range, and a range
  such as `^0.37.1` does not accept `0.38.1` for a pre-1.0 package.
  After startup settles, the client checks the npm registry for the latest
  Agent Browser version. When a newer version exists, Jean shows a persistent
  notification with **Update** and **Later** actions. Jean does not update the
  browser until the user selects **Update**.

- **Terminal** - Built-in PTY terminal emulator (`src-tauri/src/terminal/`).
  On Unix, terminals launched with a command run it through the user's
  interactive login shell so package scripts and native CLI sessions inherit
  the same PATH as a normally opened terminal. Structured command arguments
  are shell-escaped before launch; Windows continues to invoke binaries or
  `.cmd`/`.bat` shims directly to avoid PowerShell argument rewriting.
  Sessions can use chat or terminal as their primary surface via
  `useUIStore.sessionPrimarySurface`. Full-screen terminal sessions own exactly
  one terminal instance via `sessionTerminalIds` and must render through
  `SingleTerminalView`/`terminal-instances.ts` so the selected experimental
  terminal renderer is respected; terminal tab bars remain only for side/drawer
  terminals. Full-screen pure CLI sessions persist their intent on `Session`
  (`primary_surface`, `terminal_command`, `terminal_label`) and lazily recreate
  a PTY only when the user reopens that session, so hidden historical CLI
  sessions do not start background processes. Native Claude terminal sessions
  receive a generated `--session-id` when created. Codex and OpenCode terminal
  sessions snapshot their backend history before launch and bind the single new
  native session/thread ID back to Jean metadata; ambiguous concurrent matches
  are never guessed. Cold restoration uses `claude --resume <id>`,
  `codex resume <id>`, or `opencode --session <id>` while preserving global
  permission/yolo flags. Legacy native terminal sessions without either a typed
  ID or persisted resume arguments show the native-history picker instead of
  silently launching an unrelated conversation. The native CLI picker also merges
  backend-owned history from local stores where stable (`~/.codex/sessions/**`
  and `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-cwd>/**`) and imports a chosen history row as
  a Jean terminal session running the backend's native resume command. Resumable
  Jean chat sessions can likewise be duplicated into a separate native-client
  terminal session from the session-tab context menu; the original chat session
  remains unchanged.

  **Codex terminal attention.** Full-screen Codex terminals receive a
  session-scoped `notify` override for the official `agent-turn-complete`
  event. Jean tails that notification file, persists the Codex thread id and
  terminal activity timestamp, marks the session waiting, invalidates session
  caches, and emits `terminal:attention`. Submitting terminal input clears the
  waiting state. The backing Jean `sessionId` must therefore be carried through
  terminal creation, native-session reconnect, frontend terminal persistence,
  `start_terminal`, and both native/WebSocket transports.

  **Web-mode persistence.** In web access (Axum HTTP server + WebSocket),
  panel/side/drawer and modal terminals survive a full browser refresh. Three
  pieces cooperate:

  **Native remote UI.** When the desktop app selects a remote Jean, it keeps
  running its bundled React UI and routes shared backend commands and events to
  that server over authenticated HTTP/WebSocket transport. Local shell
  operations such as clipboard access, external URL opening, native menus, and
  notifications continue to use the local Tauri runtime. When the preferred
  editor is Zed, "Open in Editor" also stays local: Jean rewrites the remote
  filesystem path to `ssh://[user@]host[:port]/path` and launches the local
  `zed` CLI (SSH fields live on the remote connection profile).

  **Native multi-server scope.** The desktop client can create independent
  background transports for enabled remote profiles. Each transport is
  isolated by server ID. Browser Web Access does not use this manager and
  continues to access only its serving Jean instance. New global client state
  must use a composite `(serverId, resourceId)` identity; raw server resource
  IDs are not globally unique.

  When an established WebSocket disconnects, the frontend reloads the page
  instead of repairing stale in-memory state. The normal
  HTTP bootstrap then restores current persisted state, while backend-owned
  jobs and terminals keep running. Before reload, the current canvas session
  modal and active session are copied to short-lived `sessionStorage` so the
  same session header is restored even if the debounced UI-state save has not
  completed yet.
  1. **Backend PTY registry** (`src-tauri/src/terminal/registry.rs`) keeps the
     real `portable_pty` process alive in `TERMINAL_SESSIONS` keyed by
     `terminal_id`. The frontend is a viewer; refresh never kills the PTY.

  2. **Event replay buffer** (`src-tauri/src/http_server/mod.rs`,
     `TERMINAL_BUFFER_MAX_EVENTS = 12000` events/terminal and
     `TERMINAL_BUFFER_MAX_BYTES = 3MB` per terminal) holds the most
     recent `terminal:output` and `terminal:started` envelopes with monotonic
     sequence numbers. After a full-page refresh, `requestTerminalReplay` asks
     for events after a given `last_seq` and the backend streams the buffered
     slice.

  3. **UI state hydration** (`src/hooks/useUIStatePersistence.ts`,
     `restoreTerminalRuntimeState`) is web-only. On load it reads
     `terminal_instances` / `terminal_active_ids` / `terminal_panel_open` /
     `terminal_visible` from `ui_state.json`, then asks the backend for
     `get_active_terminals`. Only persisted terminals whose IDs are still live
     survive the filter; dead-PTY entries are cleared along with their
     `sessionTerminalIds` mappings.

  The frontend module-level Map in `src/lib/terminal-instances.ts` is the
  xterm.js cache; it survives React mount/unmount but not page refresh. After a
  refresh, `attachToContainer` checks `has_active_terminal` and, if true, calls
  `requestTerminalReplay(terminalId, 0)` so the buffered output is painted back
  into a fresh xterm.

  **Ordering pitfall.** `TerminalView`'s auto-create-default-shell effect is
  gated by `useUIStore.uiStateInitialized`. That flag flips to `true` only
  after `useUIStatePersistence` finishes its async hydrate — otherwise the
  effect would race `restoreTerminalRuntimeState`, spawn a phantom shell that
  gets overwritten when restore completes, and leave an orphan PTY in
  `TERMINAL_SESSIONS`. Don't remove the `uiStateInitialized` guard without
  re-checking the race.

- **Background Tasks** - Git/PR polling with focus-aware intervals (`src-tauri/src/background_tasks/`); Auto Fix (Mr. Robot) issue polling/planning/yolo handoff and scheduler active-hours window via `chrono` local time with midnight-crossing support (`jean-core/src/auto_fix/`). Scans list only issue numbers + labels; worktrees are never auto-archived; closed/ineligible ones stop using capacity, get their queued or running plan-mode investigation stopped, and never go to yolo; failed starts/yolo runs give up after 3 attempts; GitHub rate limits defer the project 15 min. Runtime status (last scan, errors, failed issues) is in memory and exposed via `get_auto_fix_status` / `clear_auto_fix_failures`
- **HTTP Server** - Tauri-free Axum server + WebSocket from `jean-core`; `src-server` provides the standalone Tokio adapter. See [server-architecture.md](./server-architecture.md).
- **Diagnostics** - CPU/memory monitoring panel (`src-tauri/src/diagnostics/`)
- **MCP** - Model Context Protocol server integration with per-project overrides (`src/services/mcp.ts`). First-party **Jean MCP** (`jean-core/src/jean_mcp_core.rs`) exposes project/worktree/session tools, usage + session model controls (`get_usage`, `set_session_model`), Run-command / panel-command dev environments (`get_run_environments`: running state, worktree/base session, startup command, ports, URL), plus the ship loop: `create_commit`, `push_worktree`, `detect_open_pr`, `link_worktree_pr`, `unlink_worktree_pr`, `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`, `run_review` (thin wrappers over existing project commands). MCP `create_session` reuses an empty, idle chat session in the worktree before it creates another session; terminal, queued, running, archived, or previously used sessions are never reused. PR tools resolve repository paths from Jean's worktree ID; creation and linking persist the PR number and URL on the worktree.
- **Model Catalog** - CDN-driven model lists and reasoning capabilities with bundled offline fallback ([model-catalog.md](./model-catalog.md))
- **CLI Management** - Claude CLI, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, OpenCode, PI, Command Code, Grok, Kimi Code, and gh CLI installation/versioning (backend-specific modules under `src-tauri/src/`)

Cursor-specific notes:

- Cursor auth/status checks must use short timeouts; `cursor-agent status/about` can hang indefinitely
- Cursor chat integration should use `cursor-agent --print --output-format stream-json` and parse structured NDJSON, not terminal text scraping
- Native Windows does not provide Cursor's OS sandbox, so Jean uses Cursor's `--sandbox disabled` allowlist mode there; enable WSL and use the Linux CLI when OS-level sandboxing is required
- Cursor only supports `--mode plan` and `--mode ask`; build/yolo omit `--mode` (defaults to full agent) and use `--sandbox disabled --force`
- Cursor `plan` runs synthesize an `EnterPlanMode` timeline item from Jean so the native plan banner/instructions survive streaming + JSONL reload
- Cursor history repair should prefer complete message snapshots / repeated-prefix cleanup; avoid destructive suffix trimming during reload

Grok-specific notes:

- Grok chat uses ACP over stdio (`grok --no-auto-update agent --leader stdio`) instead of `grok -p`, because headless `-p` streaming JSON does not expose reliable tool-call events. `--leader` attaches that client to Grok's shared leader (`~/.grok/leader.sock`), which Grok starts if needed. MCP and the agent backend are shared across Jean sessions; each session still has its own stdio client and ACP session.
- On Unix, one detached Grok ACP host stays alive per Jean session and accepts follow-up prompts on a stable socket. `keep_ai_servers_warm` gates it: on, the host idle-stops after 10 minutes; off, it exits when the turn finishes. Those hosts share one Grok leader, so a new session attaches to the already-running backend instead of starting a private agent and a private MCP set. A model, effort, execution-mode, working-directory, or MCP change replaces that session's host and reloads via persisted `grok_session_id`. Cancelling a turn sends ACP `session/cancel` and leaves the host up when that prompt finishes.
- ACP `session/update` chunks are mapped to Jean's common chat stream events (`chat:chunk`, `chat:tool_use`, `chat:tool_result`, `chat:done`), and ACP session ids are persisted as `grok_session_id` for later `session/load`.
- Jean implements the minimal ACP client surface Grok needs for headless tool execution: `session/request_permission`, `terminal/*`, and text-file read/write requests. Plan mode auto-approves research tools (`read`/`search`/`think`/`fetch`/`execute`, including `run_terminal_command` / `terminal/*`) so investigations can use `gh`/`git`/`rg`/etc., and denies mutating file tools (`edit`/`delete`/`move`/`write`) plus hard-blocks `fs/write`; build/yolo auto-approve via ACP/CLI flags. Synthetic ExitPlanMode is only injected for plan-like content (not short research preambles).
- **All modes** launch Grok ACP with `--no-plan`. Grok's native `exit_plan_mode` requires the TUI approval surface ACP cannot show; leaving native plan enabled caused Jean plan-mode turns to hang after research. Jean plan mode is enforced with a plan-mode system instruction, mutation-blocking tool permissions, and synthetic ExitPlanMode. Build/yolo also pass `--always-approve`.
- Grok CLI currently advertises `promptCapabilities.image: false`. Jean rejects raster image attachments before saving or sending them, preserves already-pending images so the user can switch backends, and also validates Grok messages in Rust to prevent binary files from reaching ACP text-file reads. SVG attachments remain supported as text files.
- **MCP:** Jean discovers Grok-visible servers from `~/.grok/config.toml` / project `.grok/config.toml`, plus Claude/Cursor/`.mcp.json` compat sources (same merge set as grok-build). Health uses `grok mcp doctor --json`. On each turn Jean (1) temporarily syncs `disabled_mcp_servers` so only session-enabled servers auto-load, (2) passes enabled configs as ACP `mcpServers` on `session/new`/`session/load`, then (3) restores the previous disabled list when the turn ends. Unix detached hosts receive MCP via `--mcp-servers-file`.

Kimi Code-specific notes:

- Jean manages the official `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code` npm package or uses a `kimi` binary from `PATH`.
- Interactive chat uses the official `kimi acp` stdio protocol. Jean maps ACP text, thinking, tool, image, session-resume, cancellation, and permission-mode behavior into the shared chat event model.
- Jean maps execution modes to Kimi's native modes: `plan` → `plan`, `build` → `auto`, and `yolo` → `yolo`. Final plan text is exposed through Jean's standard plan-approval tool shape.
- Kimi session IDs are persisted as `kimi_session_id`; each follow-up starts a fresh ACP process and uses `session/resume` for conversation continuity. On Unix, interactive turns run through a detached Jean ACP host (`--jean-kimi-acp-host`) that owns Kimi's stdio, appends ACP updates to the run JSONL, accepts cancellation over a short local socket, and can be reattached through `resume_session` after Jean restarts. Windows retains the attached, non-survivable fallback.
- Configured models are discovered with `kimi provider list --json`. Magic-prompt operations use `kimi -p` with strict JSON instructions and validation because Kimi Code does not expose a native JSON Schema output flag.
- MCP entries are discovered from `~/.kimi-code/mcp.json` and project-local `.kimi-code/mcp.json`; Kimi Code loads those servers when the ACP session starts.

## Performance Patterns

### The `getState()` Pattern (Critical)

**Problem**: Store subscriptions in callbacks cause render cascades.

**Solution**: Use `getState()` for callbacks that need current state:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Stable callback, no cascades
const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
  const { currentData, updateData } = useStore.getState()
  updateData(currentData.modified)
}, []) // Empty deps - stable reference

// ❌ Bad: Re-creates on every state change
const { currentData, updateData } = useStore()
const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
  updateData(currentData.modified)
}, [currentData, updateData]) // Cascades on every change
```

See [performance-patterns.md](./performance-patterns.md) for complete patterns.

## Security Architecture

### Rust-First Security

All file operations happen in Rust with built-in validation:

```rust
// Path validation prevents traversal attacks
fn is_blocked_directory(path: &Path) -> bool {
    let blocked_patterns = ["/System/", "/usr/", "/etc/", "/.ssh/"];
    blocked_patterns.iter().any(|pattern| path.starts_with(pattern))
}
```

### Input Sanitization

```rust
// Filename sanitization
pub fn sanitize_filename(filename: &str) -> String {
    filename.chars()
        .filter(|c| !['/', '\\', ':', '*', '?', '"', '<', '>', '|'].contains(c))
        .collect()
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Multi-Source Event Coordination

The same action can be triggered from multiple sources:

```typescript
// All trigger the same command
handleKeyboard('cmd+comma') → commandContext.openPreferences()
handleMenu('menu-preferences') → commandContext.openPreferences()
handleCommand('open-preferences') → commandContext.openPreferences()
```

### Atomic File Operations

All disk writes use atomic operations to prevent corruption:

```rust
// Write to temp file, then rename (atomic)
std::fs::write(&temp_path, content)?;
std::fs::rename(&temp_path, &final_path)?;
```

### Image Processing

Images pasted, dropped, or selected from the native file picker into chat are processed in Rust before saving:

- **Resize**: Max 1568px on longest side (Claude's internal limit)
- **Compress**: Opaque PNGs → JPEG at 85% quality (typically 5-10x smaller)
- **Skip**: GIFs (may be animated), images < 50KB, already-compressed formats
- Token cost: `(width × height) / 750` tokens per image

### Headless Mode

The embedded Axum HTTP server enables running Jean without the native window:

- Serves the bundled frontend via `ServeDir`
- WebSocket provides real-time event streaming (mirrors Tauri's `emit`/`listen` pattern)
- Bearer token authentication; configurable port; localhost-only by default

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates

Before any changes are committed:

```bash
bun run check:all  # Runs all checks
```

This includes:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting
- Prettier formatting
- Vitest tests
- Rust formatting (cargo fmt)
- Rust linting (clippy)
- Rust tests

### Documentation-Driven Development

1. **Understand patterns** - Read relevant docs in `docs/developer/`
2. **Follow established patterns** - Don't invent new approaches
3. **Update docs** - Document new patterns as they emerge
4. **Test comprehensively** - Use the established testing patterns

## Extension Points

### Adding New Features

1. **Commands** - Add to appropriate command group file
2. **State** - Choose appropriate layer (useState/Zustand/TanStack Query)
3. **UI** - Follow component architecture guidelines
4. **Persistence** - Use established data persistence patterns
5. **Testing** - Add tests following established patterns
6. **Documentation** - Update relevant docs

### Adding New Systems

When adding entirely new systems:

1. **Create focused docs** - Add new file to `docs/developer/`
2. **Follow architectural patterns** - Use established bridge patterns
3. **Integrate with command system** - Make actions discoverable
4. **Add keyboard shortcuts** - Follow shortcut conventions
5. **Update this guide** - Add system to architecture overview

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Follow the onion** - Use the three-layer state architecture
2. **Commands everywhere** - Route all actions through the command system
3. **Performance first** - Use `getState()` pattern to avoid cascades
4. **Security by default** - Validate all inputs, especially file paths
5. **Event-driven bridges** - Keep Rust and React loosely coupled
6. **Test everything** - Use quality gates to maintain code health
7. **Document patterns** - Keep docs current as patterns evolve

### Cross-platform CLI resolution and launch

When resolving external CLIs from PATH, use `crate::platform::detect_cli_in_path()` or
`crate::platform::find_cli_in_host_path()` instead of parsing `where`/`which` output manually.
On Windows, npm installs can return an extensionless Unix shim before the runnable `.cmd`/`.exe`
shim; the shared selector ranks `.exe`, `.cmd`, `.bat`, extensionless, then `.ps1`.

When launching a resolved CLI path, use `crate::platform::cli_command()` instead of
`silent_command()` directly. It keeps `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, redirects an extensionless Windows shim to
its `.exe`/`.cmd`/`.bat` sibling, and routes commands through WSL when WSL mode is enabled. Pass the
working directory as the `cwd` argument so WSL launches receive `wsl.exe --cd ...` rather than a
host-only cwd. Use `host_cli_command()` instead when the arguments are host paths that a Linux CLI
inside the WSL distro could not act on, such as `npm install --prefix <app data dir>`.

A `.cmd`/`.bat` shim cannot be launched by `CreateProcessW` directly, and the two ways to launch one
are not interchangeable. `cli_command()` wraps it in `cmd.exe /C`, which tolerates arguments
containing newlines — agent backends pass whole chat prompts and pretty-printed JSON schemas as
arguments, so they need this. `host_cli_command()` instead leaves the shim as the program so
`std::process` builds the `cmd.exe` line, escaping each argument for batch parsing, quoting the line
so a spaced shim path such as `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd` still parses, and passing `/d` so
AutoRun cannot run. `std` rejects CR/LF in batch arguments, so only use `host_cli_command()` where
arguments are simple values such as package names and paths. Do not hand-roll either wrap at a call
site.

To launch a tool by bare name from PATH (`npm`, `npx`, `node`), use
`crate::platform::path_tool_command()`. Windows `PATH` search only appends `.exe`, so spawning bare
`npm` cannot find the `npm.cmd` a stock Node.js install ships (issue #675). A test in
`platform/cli_detect.rs` fails the build if `npm`/`npx` are ever spawned by bare name again.

When opening a URL in the system browser, use `crate::platform::open_url_in_browser()` (also
re-exported as `jean_core::open_url_in_browser`). On Windows it runs `cmd /c start` through
`silent_command()` so the intermediary console never flashes. Do not call raw
`Command::new("cmd")` with `/c start`.

## Antigravity CLI backend

Jean integrates Google's native `agy` executable through its documented headless interface. Interactive turns use `agy -p --output-format stream-json`; structured one-shot operations use `--output-format json --json-schema`. Jean maps Plan to `--mode plan`, Build to `--mode accept-edits`, and Yolo to `--mode accept-edits --dangerously-skip-permissions`.

Antigravity conversation IDs are stored in `antigravity_session_id`. Follow-up turns resume with `--conversation`. Jean stores the NDJSON output in its run log, maps text, thinking, tool, result, and usage events to the common chat model, and cancels by stopping the registered process tree.

Tool steps use the documented nested `tool_info` object. Subagent steps use `subagent_info` and are normalized into Jean's agent activity model. Terminal result states are authoritative: error and waiting states fail the turn, while canceled and interrupted states are stored as cancellations. Jean can also discover the latest workspace conversation from `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/cache/last_conversations.json`.

Antigravity MCP servers come from project `.agents/mcp_config.json` and user `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`. Antigravity CLI owns authentication and secrets in the operating system keyring; Jean does not copy OAuth tokens.

Headless mode has no interactive approval surface. Plan is read-only and sandboxed. Build runs in Antigravity's native terminal sandbox and auto-approves tools so a default `request-review` policy does not soft-deny required commands. Yolo explicitly auto-approves without the sandbox. Jean queues follow-up messages because the headless interface does not expose in-turn steering.

Magic Prompts pass Jean's contract to Antigravity's native `--json-schema` option and read `structured_output` from the final JSON envelope.
